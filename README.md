# $\mathrm{CO_2}$-Equilibrium

This repository is designed to be a customizable set of resources to facilitate the understanding of the inorganic chemistry of carbon in water.

An introduction to scientific Python programming using Google Colab along with the Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas libraries.

An introduction to solving equilibrium problems using mass balance, charge balance, and non-linear least squares. [Solving Equilibrium Problems Using Python.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wphall/CO2-Equilibrium/blob/main/Solving_Equilibrium_Problems_Using_Python.ipynb)

[A student notebook divided into seven parts](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wphall/CO2-Equilibrium/blob/main/Student_Notebook_CO2_Equilibrium.ipynb#scrollTo=DQFCCLpto973):

Parts I to III of this notebook many of the code segments are left blank and are intended to be filled in by the students as they work through the caluclations.

An optional introduction to looping in Python, storing large datasets as a Pandas dataframe, and plotting using Matplotlib with annotation and labeling. [Handling Data with Pandas and Matplotlib.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wphall/CO2-Equilibrium/blob/main/Handling_Data_with_Pandas_and_Matplotlib.ipynb)

Part IV is a study of the effect of atmospheric CO2 on the pH of rainwater.  At the end of this sections the students will have made a plot of pH as a function of partial pressure of $\mathrm{CO_2}$ and compared their experimental result with theory.  Some instructors may choose to stop here.

Parts V to VII build on the previous sections by adding the presence of solid calcium carbonate and taking into account the affects of temerature and ionic strength.  Due to the complexity of these calculations, a larger amount of the code is provided.  By the end of the notebook, students will constuct a model for understanding the effect of atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_2}$ on the pH of oceans.
